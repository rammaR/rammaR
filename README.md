  I'd like to be a full stack developer because they have liberty to collaborate in a bunch of levels of programming.
  
- 👀 I’m interested in programation with Java and Delphi on backend, Angular, Ionic, Typescript at the front.
  But i know that i still have to learn ReactJs, ReactNative and Kotlin. Is my future goals.
  
- 🌱 I’m currently doing a bunch of courses through bootcamps to update my skills. I am liking to learn more about Java,
  Spring, JPA and so on. But also have a project made in Angular in production, that a like to much.
